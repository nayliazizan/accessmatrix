Brief about the AM system

1. The Business Insight Access Metrics (AM) System is a web-based tool designed to automate and simplify the management of employee access permissions within the Management Information System (MIS) department.

2. Currently, MIS staff manually handle access lists for Business Insight, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This can lead to inaccurate data, unauthorized access, and security vulnerabilities. The AM System addresses these challenges by automating routine tasks, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring data integrity.

3. The AM System boasts a user-friendly interface that empowers MIS staff to: 
    a.	Add, update, or remove employees from access lists with ease. 
    b.	Identify inactive employees through the "Difference Tracker" module, facilitating prompt action. 
    c.	Log changes and generate reports for comprehensive auditing and data tracking. 
    d.	Manage groups, licenses, and projects effectively, ensuring granular control over user permissions. 
    e.	Access a visual dashboard for insights into staff distribution across groups.

4. The AM System is specifically designed for six MIS staff members, including the department manager.

5. The AM System operates within the Bank Rakyat HQ (Mr Hafidzâ€™s laptop) network, ensuring secure and authorized access.

6. Impact: By automating access management, the AM System promises to: 
    a.	Boost efficiency and productivity for MIS staff. 
    b.	Minimize human error and data inconsistencies. 
    c.	Enhance security by preventing unauthorized access. 
    d.	Improve auditability and compliance with regulations.

7. This innovative solution empowers the MIS department to manage access permissions with greater efficiency, accuracy, and security, ultimately contributing to a more streamlined and secure work environment.
